# Boiler 1
Boiler 1 was a D-type water-tube boiler produced by English Boiler in 1953. It was installed and started making steam for the campus in 1965. It was then upgraded to a new larger unit in 2005.

- Water-tube boilers are designed to circulate hot combustion gases or flue gas around the outside of a large number of water-filled tubes. As the flue gas passes through the tubes, it heats the tubes, which then heat the water to produce steam.
- The tubes extend between an upper header, called a steam drum, and a lower header, called a mud drum or sometimes, a water drum. Tubes are either straight or bent into simple or complex shapes.
- Water-tube boilers are designed to circulate hot combustion gases or flue gas around the outside of a large number of water-filled tubes. As the flue gas passes through the tubes, it heats the tubes, which then heats the water. As more heat is transferred, the water temperature keeps rising until it reaches the saturation temperature and water changes phase from liquid to vapor or steam.
- Boiler 1 can produce 25,000 pounds of saturated steam per hour at the pressure of 100 psi, at a temperature of 338 degrees Fahrenheit. The steam is sent out to the buildings on campus through an underground piping system.

## Liquid-vapor saturation curve of water

<span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/panoMedia/infoImages/liquidVaporSaturationCurve-Graph.png %}" alt="" /></span>
The saturated temperature of steam varies with the boiler pressure at which water is heated. The saturated temperature rises when pressure is increased, and the temperature goes down when pressure is decreased. For example, the saturated temperature of the steam is 212 degrees Fahrenheit at the atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psi. This state of steam is represented by point A on a diagram called the Liquid-vapor saturation curve of water. Inside the boiler, where the pressure is set at 114.7 psi, the temperature of saturated steam increases to 338 degrees Fahrenheit at point B.
