## This is a Preview
Only the first floor of the building is available right now with access to the basement,
the catwalk scaffolding and even the roof coming later to help you appreciate the full
extent of this energy efficient facility at use right here on our campus. You can feel
free to spend some time in the tour before proceeding to the first thermodynamic topic
in this educational journey.
